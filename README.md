# Predicting Bike Sharing Patterns

## Introduction

In this project, we will get to build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset made available by UCI Machine Learning Database. By building a neural network from the ground up, we will have a much better understanding of the following topics:

* gradient descent
* backpropagation
* numpy matrix manipulation

## Description

The problem description and solution is provided in the BikeSharing folder. To get started, you can clone the repository to your local folder. Alternatively, you can also download the zipped file. Once extracted in a folder on your local drive, you will find the data and Jupyter notebook in the BikeSharing folder. You can launch the Jupyter notebook on your local machine and start using the solution. We want to predict how many bikes a store needs to keep in a given day such that they are not idling in the store, and are also enough to meet the bike demand so the store does not lose business. We are looking for that optimal number. The solution will provide a prediction on bike numbers to meet daily demands.

## Getting Started

* git clone https://github.com/amitksinhaz/BikeSharingPrediction.git
* cd project-directory
  
From the repo, following Python notebook files can be used. The notebook with answers is my-answers.ipynb
* jupyter notebook Predicting_bike_sharing_data.ipynb
* jupyter notebook my-answers.ipynb

## Setting up Python Environment

Refer to link https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/blob/master/README.md

In summary, install the miniconda environment followed by the machine learning libraries including PyTorch
