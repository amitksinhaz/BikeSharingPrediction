# Predicting Bike Sharing Patterns

In this project, we will get to build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset made available by UCI Machine Learning Database. By building a neural network from the ground up, we will have a much better understanding of following topics:

* gradient descent
* backpropagation
* numpy matrix multiplication for weight and feature summation
